The Ninth Blackstone Fortress is a recently discovered Blackstone Fortress, that lies within the outer regions of Ultima Segmentum.

**Blackstone Fortresses** are planetoid-sized crafts, which generate immense amounts of power even while dormant. Their technology goes far beyond the current knowledge of any species in the galaxy. Once fully activated, a **Blackstone Fortress** is capable of breaking the barrier between realspace and warpspace, creating a beam of pure immaterium to destroy everything in its path. This power can be linked with other Fortresses to create an even more powerful beam, as was evident when **Abaddon the Despoiler** used two Fortresses to destroy the planet **Fularis II**, and three to cause the **Tarantis** star to go supernova. Abaddon was able to remotely control the Blackstone Fortresses with the alien artifacts **Hand of Darkness** and **Eye of Night**. **Huron Blackheart's** Blackstone Fortress has a **Webway** gate at its heart, that the **Masque of the Shattered Mirage** were able to use.
